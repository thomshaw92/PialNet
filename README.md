# PialNet
Repo for the 2020 UQ Summer  School of AI Hackathon project: "Segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Angiography data"

## Goal: Providing an automated pial vessel segmentation framework that learns vessels of interest in high-resolution MRA data, from synthetic data.

Input: 3D MRA scans
Output: Binary 3D mask of vessels
Database: DeepVesselNet synthetic data
Methods: ???

## Slides from Dr. Saskia Bollmann's pitch can be found here:

## Training data examples and validation sample can be found here:

NB: we cannot provide validation data, but we can show examples and run code on the data on Wiener
